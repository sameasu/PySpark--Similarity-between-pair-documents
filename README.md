# PySpark--Similarity-between-pair-documents
This project is part of my practice of MapReduce thinking. 

Business application is to identify similar documents and come up with grouping of the same.
This helps to identify and cluster similar documents amongst millions of documents.

Here, documents can be text extraction from pdfs, webpage etc.

Currently the project uses the data from sample datasets from MongoDB (source: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-mflix/#sample_mflix.movies)
